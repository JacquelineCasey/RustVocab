# Rust Vocab

Apparently the US higher education system thinks I need to learn a bunch of vocab
in order to get a good score on the GRE. I also want to learn Rust, and a simple
CLI application seems like a good second-ish project (after exercises in the Rust
Book).

Also kinda making a little library for efficient and consistent prompts in CLI apps.
I want them to display help information, and do validation, etc.
